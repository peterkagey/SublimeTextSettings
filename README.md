# SublimeTextSettings
This is a tiny repo to store my settings and scripts for Sublime Text 3.

If you want to try out these settings and __destructively__ delete your settings in the same step:

```
cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages
git remote add origin https://github.com/peterokagey/SublimeTextSettings.git
git fetch
git checkout -t origin/master -f
```

I didn't try this script outâ€”so file an issue if it doesn't work for you.
